For Dev 1 I plan to go with a new program instead of the previous program to really hone and learn more from my newly aquired skills. This new program will be a way for
users to input information such as day, birthdate, their mood and maybe a few more inputs as I do more research on the topic. Once they input this data the program will
store only the necessary data needed in local storage, then run computations against these values and return several different bits of information based on the input.
The most prominent return will be the mood message, based on the users mood the message will return an inspirational message that counters the given mood. This will
be done with a random array of objects strategy and the dataset used will be famous quotes from famous people so that it will remain public domain. From there the program
will take into consideration the current day and return meaningful astrological data and horroscope data to match bday/day/month/year/etc and will be geared towards
motivating the end user to have a meaningful and positive day.
